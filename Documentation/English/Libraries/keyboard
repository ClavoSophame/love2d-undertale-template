First parameter: The key's scancode
Return: The state of the key.

Keyboard:ReturnText()
Return: The text that has been typed.

This will make the text variable grow as you type.

If you want to delete characters from the text, you can check for the backspace key.

if (Keyboard:GetState("backspace") == 1) then
    text = text:sub(1, -2)
end

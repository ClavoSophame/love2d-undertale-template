scene_battle.lua

This is the only battle scene in the template, and it's very important.
If the battle scene is lost, most of the battle UI logic might need to be rewritten.

Customizable Part:
ENEMIES = {
    {
        name = "Poseur",  -- The name displayed for the enemy
        hp = 100,         -- Current HP
        maxhp = 1000,     -- Maximum HP
        killable = true,  -- Whether the enemy dies when hp reaches 0 (can be used for special cases like Sans)
        xp = 999,         -- XP granted upon enemy defeat
        gold = 999,       -- Gold granted upon enemy defeat
        pos = {120, 130}, -- Position of the enemy (for adjusting attack location)
        maxhurt = 100,    -- Maximum damage that can be dealt to the enemy
        actions = {
            "Check", "Talk"  -- Available actions during battle (e.g., ACT options)
        }
    }
}
name: The name displayed for the enemy.
hp: The enemy's current HP.
maxhp: The enemy's maximum HP.
killable: Whether the enemy will be removed from the battle when its HP is less than or equal to 0 (this can be used for special scenarios like monster last words, e.g., Sans).
xp, gold: The amount of XP and gold the player gains upon the enemy's defeat.
pos: The position of the enemy (used to adjust the attack position).
maxhurt: The maximum amount of damage that can be inflicted on the enemy.
actions: The available actions for the "ACT" phase (such as "Check" and "Talk").
Note: You can add multiple enemies here.

Handling Items:

local function HandleItems(item)
    if (item == "Pie") then
        BattleDialogue({"* You ate the Pie...", SetItemHPText(19), "[noskip][function:StateTo|ACTIONSELECT]"})
        player:Heal(19)
    end
end
The HandleItems function manages what happens when an item is selected.
In the example, selecting the "Pie" item triggers the associated actions.
If an item has a color, make sure to include that in the condition for checking.

SetItemHPText(number hp): This function sets the HP value and creates a sentence such as "You healed xx HP" or "Your HP is back to full."
BattleDialogue(table texts): This creates a typewriter effect within the battle box, displaying text like dialogue.
